# fpga-DNN-inference

Pure-RTL (VHDL) NN inference pipeline targeting the Digilent Nexys Video.

## Quick Start
- Build bitstream (Vivado CLI):
  - `make build`
- Program FPGA (Vivado CLI):
  - `vivado -mode batch -source scripts/program_fpga.tcl`
  - or pass a specific bitfile: `vivado -mode batch -source scripts/program_fpga.tcl -tclargs /path/to.bit`


## Repo Layout
- `rtl/`: synthesizable VHDL
- `constraints/`: board constraints (XDC)
- `scripts/`: build/sim helpers
- `sim/`: testbenches and fixtures
- `host/python/`: host-side tooling
- `nn`: train DNN, generate hls4ml rtl


## Debugging Notes

I'm saving these here for future reference, as they were particularly tricky to solve. Future bugs may not be identical, but hopefully they will rhyme.

### UART Debugging Notes
We hit a UART bring-up issue where the FPGA would not respond to STATUS requests. The key lessons:

1) **LED meaning matters**: LD13/LD12 indicate PC->board and board->PC traffic, not raw FPGA RX/TX. Seeing TX blink without RX does not guarantee the UART path is parsing packets.
2) **On-board FT232R wiring**: The Nexys Video USB-UART bridge (J13) uses V18 (uart_tx_in, PC->FPGA) and AA19 (uart_rx_out, FPGA->PC). These must match the `uart_rx`/`uart_tx` pins in the XDC.
3) **UART RX verified**: We added temporary LED instrumentation in `rtl/top/top_nexys_video.vhd`:
   - `led(6)` mirrors the raw `uart_rx` pin (idle high)
   - `led(7)` toggles on each `rx_valid` pulse
4) **Root cause**: The top-level only responded to `INFER_REQ`, so `STATUS_REQ` never produced a response. Fixing this by integrating `mmio_status` + `perf_counters` in `top_nexys_video.vhd` made STATUS return correctly.

Rebuild and reprogram commands:
```bash
vivado -mode batch -source scripts/build_vivado.tcl &&                                     
vivado -mode batch -source scripts/program_fpga.tcl
```

Send STATUS (`--status`) protocol packet using command:
```bash
python host/python/nnfpga/send_uart.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --status --verbose --baud 115200
```
Output:
```
Using STATUS_REQ packet
Wrote response to sim/fixtures/uart_last_rsp.hex
Response type: 0x81, payload length: 20
```

Once the STATUS path returned a valid packet (`0x81` with 20-byte payload), UART bring-up was confirmed and we proceeded to INFER tests. 

We sent a real STATUS_REQ packet (type 0x01) using the same header/format as the inference packets, but make no mistake, it is not inference. It's a real protocol request and exercises the UART + packet parsing + response path.

### Hardware Inference Workflow Notes
If INFER responses mismatch the golden file, the most common cause is using a **PyTorch** golden while the FPGA runs **hls4ml-quantized** math. Generate fixtures from hls4ml to match the hardware:

```bash
python sim/models/nn_golden.py \
  --config nn/configs/calhouse.yaml \
  --checkpoint nn/outputs/calhouse/default/model.pt \
  --use-hls4ml
```

Then ensure the FPGA bitfile is built from the same model export:

```bash
python nn/scripts/run_hls4ml.py --config nn/hls4ml_config.yaml --clean --all
scripts/sync_hls4ml_ip.sh
vivado -mode batch -source scripts/build_vivado.tcl
vivado -mode batch -source scripts/program_fpga.tcl
```

Run inference over UART:
```bash
python host/python/nnfpga/send_uart.py \
  --port /dev/ttyUSB0 \
  --req sim/fixtures/nn_in.hex \
  --expect sim/fixtures/nn_out.hex \
  --baud 115200
```

### Debugging Note: “Quantized Golden Mismatch”
**Symptom:** RTL sim (`tb_top_e2e`) and hardware UART both returned a valid `INFER_RSP`, but payload bytes
did not match `nn_out.hex` (example mismatch at payload byte 0).

**Root cause:** The golden fixture was generated by running hls4ml on **float** inputs, while the hardware
receives **fixed-point quantized** inputs. That changes the final output by a few LSBs (e.g. `FE89` vs `FE83`).

**Fix:** When generating golden fixtures with `--use-hls4ml`, first quantize the inputs exactly as the UART
payload will be transmitted (done in `sim/models/nn_golden.py`). After regenerating `nn_out.hex`, RTL sim
and hardware matched.
